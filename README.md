# Eva (Discord Bot)
coded in Javascript (nodejs)

1. Set up a Discord bot account:
   - Go to the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.
   - Navigate to the "Bot" tab and click on "Add Bot" to create a bot user for your application.
   - Customize the bot's name, avatar, and permissions as per your requirements.

2. Set up your development environment:
   - Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your system.
   - Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project using the command: `npm init`

3. Install the necessary packages:
   - Install the `discord.js` package, which provides a powerful API for interacting with Discord:
     ```shell
     npm install discord.js
     ```

4. Log in your bot:
   - Obtain your bot's token from the Discord Developer Portal.
   - Add the following code at the end of your `bot.js` file to log in your bot using its token:
     ```javascript
     client.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN');
     ```
     Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` with your actual bot token.

5. Run your bot:
   - In your terminal, navigate to the project directory.
   - Start your bot by running the command: `node bot.js`
   - If everything is set up correctly, your bot should come online and be ready to respond to events and commands on the Discord server.

# deployment
Autocode is a platform that simplifies the deployment and hosting process for Discord bots, allowing you to focus more on developing the bot's functionality rather than managing the infrastructure. Here are the steps to deploy a Discord bot using Autocode:

1. Sign up for an Autocode account:
   - Go to the Autocode website (https://autocode.com/) and sign up for a free account.
   - Follow the instructions to create your account and verify your email address.

2. Create a new project:
   - Once you're logged in, click on "Create Project" to start a new project.
   - Select the "Discord Bot" template from the available options.

3. Connect your Discord account:
   - After creating the project, click on the "Configure" button next to the Discord integration.
   - Follow the prompts to authorize Autocode to access your Discord account.
   - Select the server where you want to deploy your bot.

4. Configure your bot:
   - In the Autocode project, you will find a file called `bot.js` or similar. This is where you'll write your bot's code.
   - Customize the code to define your bot's functionality and behavior. You can use the Discord.js library or any other libraries you need.
   - Autocode provides you with a built-in code editor for making changes to your code.

5. Test your bot locally:
   - Before deploying, it's a good practice to test your bot locally to ensure it's working as expected.
   - Autocode provides a local development environment that allows you to test your code before deploying it.
   - Follow the instructions in the Autocode documentation to set up and run the local development environment.

6. Deploy your bot:
   - Once you're satisfied with your bot's functionality, you can deploy it to your Discord server.
   - Click on the "Deploy" button in the Autocode project interface.
   - Autocode will handle the deployment process and configure the necessary infrastructure to host your bot.

7. Interact with your bot:
   - After deployment, your bot will be active on the selected Discord server.
   - You can test your bot's functionality by interacting with it through the Discord server.
   - Autocode automatically handles the hosting and scaling of your bot, allowing it to handle multiple server requests simultaneously.

8. Monitor and manage your bot:
   - Autocode provides monitoring and logging features to help you track your bot's performance and debug any issues.
   - You can access these features through the Autocode project dashboard.
